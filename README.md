# CGFusionFormer

we propose a CGFusionFormer to address the challenge of relatively low quality of 2D joint detection and significant computational costs of 3D human pose estimation. Our proposed method significantly outperforms other transformer-based variants in short receptive fields and achieves a superior speed accuracy trade-off compared to prior approaches.The code is about to be open source.
